### Stochastic simulations of classroom-level COVID-19 outbreaks 

This repository contains code associated with a preprint exploring COVID-19 outbreaks in classrooms, and how these might be managed with 
several different protocols: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.20.20216267v1

The model is written in matlab, with outbreak visualization in matlab and other plots for the manuscript in R.
