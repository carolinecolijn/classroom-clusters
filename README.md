### Stochastic simulations of classroom-level COVID-19 outbreaks 


This repository contains code associated with a preprint exploring COVID-19 outbreaks in classrooms, and how these might be managed with 
several different protocols: [COVID-19's unfortunate events in schools: mitigating classroom clusters in the context of variable transmission](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.20.20216267v1)

The model is written in Matlab, with outbreak visualization in Matlab and other plots for the manuscript in R. 

The folder ['basic%20simulations'](basic simulations) contains the files necessary for reproducing most of the simulations in the preprint. Simulations for the elementary schools and highschools with structures currently in place in BC are obtained by running ['generate_spreadsheet.m'](basic simulations/generate_spreadsheet.m')
